# DIVAnd-singularity
Singularity container for `DIVAnd`, the interpolation tool (https://github.com/gher-uliege/DIVAnd.jl).

The container installs the last stable release of [`Julia`](https://julialang.org/), `DIVAnd` and other required Julia packages.

## Dependencies

* Install singularity: https://sylabs.io/docs/

## Building

After checking out the source, the singularity container is build using:

```bash
rm -f DIVAnd.sif; sudo singularity build DIVAnd.sif Singularity
```
The first command is only needed if you already had the `.sif` file in your system.     
The _build_ operation lasts severall minutes due to the download and installation of languages and libraries.

## Download

### From the GitHub _actions_
- go to https://github.com/gher-uliege/DIVAnd-singularity/actions,
- choose the lastest commit,
- go to artefact,
- download and unzip the image file.

## Running the container

There are two ways to run the container:

#### 1. Without specifying a Julia script
```bash
singularity run DIVAnd.sif
``` 
This gives access to a Julia terminal, where commands and scripts can be executed.
#### 2. By specifying the script to be run
```bash
singularity run DIVAnd.sif my_script.jl
``` 
(where `my_script.jl` has to be substitued by the correct file name).

## Acknowledgements
